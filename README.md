# cloudformation-infra-code

This repository contains code for creating resources in AWS using Cloudformation.
For this handson project I have created VPC, subnets, Internet Gateway , RouteTables to setup a stable private network environment.
We have created an EC2 instance whose type can be decided while running the code using parameters.
We have also created an S3 bucket within the same VPC that can be used for storing images later on.
